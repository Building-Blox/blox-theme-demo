Variables

CSS variables are generally used in place of Sass variables because shared Blox components can't access 
global Sass variables. This is intentional so that the Blox framework isn't coupled with one particular framework.
Other reasons why CSS variables are favoured are: unlike SASS variables, custom properties 1) are scoped to the 
element they are declared on, 2) cascade and 3) can be manipulated in JavaScript.
